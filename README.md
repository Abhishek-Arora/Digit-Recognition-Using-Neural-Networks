# Digit-Recognition-Using-Neural-Networks
This project implements backpropagation for training a neural network with one hidden layer for digit recogntion problem.

##Data
The dataset is a collection of images of digits and can be found in the directory named 'images'.

*  nntrain.m - This file contains a data structure for representing a neural network and its weights are provided, as is code for feeding examples through the network to
compute activations and node values.
